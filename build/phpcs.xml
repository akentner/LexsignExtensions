    Include all sniffs in the PEAR standard. Note that the
    path to the standard does not have to be specified as the
    PEAR standard exists inside the PHP_CodeSniffer install
    directory.

 <!--
    Include all sniffs in an external standard directory. Note
    that we have to specify the full path to the standard's
    directory because it does not exist inside the PHP_CodeSniffer
    install directory.

 <!--
    Include everything in another ruleset.xml file. This is
    really handy if you want to customise another developer's
    custom standard. They just need to distribute their single
    ruleset file to allow this.
 -->
<!-- <rule ref="/home/username/standards/custom.xml"/>-->

 <!--
    Include some specific sniffs from the Generic standard.
    Note again that the name of the sniff is the code that
    PHP_CodeSniffer gives it.

 <!--
    Here we are including a specific sniff but also changing
    the error message of a specific message inside the sniff.
    Note that the specific code for the message, which is
    CommentFound in this case, is defined by the sniff developer.
    You can display these codes by using the -s command line
    argument when checking a file.

    Also note that this message has a variable inside it,
    which is why it is important that sniffs use a printf style
    format for their error messages.

    We also drop the severity of this message from the
    default value (5) so that it is hidden by default. It can be
    displayed by setting the minimum severity on the PHP_CodeSniffer
    command line. This is great if you want to use some messages
    only in code reviews and not have them block code commits.

 <!--
    If you want to completely disable an error message in a sniff
    but you don't want to exclude the whole sniff, you can
    change the severity of the message to 0. In this case, we
    want the Squiz DoubleQuoteUsage sniff to be included in our
    standard, but we don't want the ContainsVar error message to
    ever be displayed.

 <!--
    There is a special internal error message produced by PHP_CodeSniffer
    when it is unable to detect code in a file, possible due to
    the use of short open tags even though php.ini disables them.
    You can disable this message in the same way as sniff messages.

    Again, the code here will be displayed in the PHP_CodeSniffer
    output when using the -s command line argument while checking a file.

 <!--
    You can also hard-code ignore patterns for specific sniffs,
    a feature not available on the command line.

    The code here will hide all messages from the Squiz DoubleQuoteUsage
    sniff for files that match either of the two exclude patterns.

 <!--
    You can also be more specific and just exclude some messages.

    The code here will just hide the ContainsVar error generated by the
    Squiz DoubleQuoteUsage sniff for files that match either of the two
    exclude patterns.
